# esx_dnaDoorManager
Syncable doors

So today I present to you a ported/converted copy of @Darklandz DRdoors! (Thank you darklandz for your awsome resource) Check out the original repo here > dRdoors 34

FEATURES:

Ability to lock PD doors (and others if you add them) :key:

- Only police can unlock and lock these doors :policeman:

- Synced with the Database! :card_file_box:

- This is the biggest diffrence from other resources such as esx_doorlock

- Easily add more doors to be locked!

- Neat and tidy DrawTxt label (Small, Simple and clean) :memo:

- Editable door locked messges (see in client.lua)

- Ability to change how long it takes for the door to lock and unlock (helps with making the door lock in its appropriate place)

- In c_doors.lua Line 76 & 79 you can change the value there.
:warning: Make sure to run the .sql file included for the doors to sync. :warning:
